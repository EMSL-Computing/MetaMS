# README

This folder contains scripts intended for reproducibility purposes. These scripts are not designed to be used as standalone modules but rather to document and replicate specific workflows or processes.

For example, the scripts used to generate the MSP database for the LCMS workflow are included here. Each script is tailored to a specific task and should be executed in the context of the described workflows.

Please refer to individual script comments for detailed usage instructions.
